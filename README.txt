= What are overrides and how do I use them? =

Overrides allow you to alter the display and information given on category and tag pages.
For a simple example, add a new query and chose the type `override`.  Choose how you want the content to display, then examine the `Override Settings` options.
Select a category or multiple categories to override.   Save the query, then visit that category page.
